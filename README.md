This project is Memory Game which fetches gif data and there unique ids to render on the webpage.

where if you click on the unique gif everytime the score will increase.

However, if you click on the already clicked gif then the game will reset and start from 0.

however, your previous High score will remain intact so you can compare your score each time.
